With landbirds density on water pixels being equal to zero, we excluded these pixels from BCUI assessment. 2.1 Scenario 5% Boxplot showing minimum and maximum (vertical lines), median (horizontal line), interquartile range (IQR, colored box), as well as outliers (black points) of boreal caribou umbrella indices (BCUI) by landbird habitat association calculated across time (2011 - 2091), climate projections (CanESM2, CCSM4 and INM-CM4) and replicates (n = 5), as well as the weighted average across these (in grey dashed line) for Scenario 5%. The average is weighted based on the number of species in each group. 2.2 Scenario 15% Boxplot showing minimum and maximum (vertical lines), median (horizontal line), interquartile range (IQR, colored box), as well as outliers (black points) of boreal caribou umbrella indices (BCUI) by landbird habitat association calculated across time (2011 - 2091), climate projections (CanESM2, CCSM4 and INM-CM4) and replicates (n = 5), as well as the weighted average across these (in grey dashed line) for Scenario 15%.

"],["individual-species-results.html", "3 Individual Species Results 3.1 Species Information 3.2 Species Results", " 3 Individual Species Results We used landbird density models based on climate, vegetation, and terrain variables, fitted as boosted regression trees; these were developed using avian point count data from the Boreal Avian Modelling (BAM) project database. The BAM database is a compilation of point-count data from projects spanning the boreal and hemi-boreal regions of North America (Cumming et al. 2010; Barker et al. 2015). BAMs human point-count survey data (1993 to 2018) were supplemented with sampling events extracted from autonomous recording units (ARU) deployed in the Northwest Territories and Alberta (2012 to 2018) by both the Canadian Wildlife Service and the University of Alberta Bioacoustic Unit (WildTrax, 2019). The species for this study were selected based on the availability of survey data and density offsets (Sólymos et al. 2013) to standardize point-count survey estimates. This resulted in models for 71 landbird species (Table 1). 3.1 Species Information The following table provides information on species and how these are generally classified: 3.2 Species Results The following sections present all individual species results: 1. Map of selected areas: Map that represents the high quality areas chosen for caribou and landbird species for 2031 and 15% of total area. Other scenarios can be seen here Linear regression results: To evaluate temporal trends in BCUI for each landbird species, we did linear regressions of BCUI against projected year and scenario, using both climate models and replicates to assess uncertainty. Here we show the model output with BIRD ~ ProportionAreaChosen + Year and plotted values with fitted linear model through time, for each scenario. 3.2.1 Alder Flycatcher The following table presents general information for Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum) Order Passeriformes Family Tyrannidae Genus Empidonax Species alnorum Scientific Name Empidonax alnorum Common Name Alder Flycatcher Species_Code ALFL Generalist/Specialist S Migration Neotropical migrant Feeding_Class_Breed1 Insectivore Substrate_Breed1 Air Forage_Breed1 Sallier Nesting_Substrate1 Shrub Nesting_Habitat1 Treed/shrubby swamp Nesting_Habitat2 Early successional Nesting_Habitat3 Bogs UICN Least Concern V18 Ground The following map represents the areas chosen by ALFL for scenario 15% and year 2031.
