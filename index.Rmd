# Appendix II

The present appendix presents (1) all individual species results, as well as (2) specific scenarios, provides direct links to the (3) output tables used for generating the results presented in the manuscript and points to the (4) repository and scripts used for this specific analysis. The content can be found in the online manual available on <http://site.address.once.ready>.

## Navigating the Appendix

Results for individual species can be seen on the panel on the left. Simply click on 
each section or subsection to see the results. These are organized in four sections:  
**1. Scenarios:** figures with habitat group results for each individual scenario (*sensu* Figure 5);    
**2. Individual Species:** figures, linear model output and maps for each individual species;  
**3. Output tables:** Tables that generated the results for and figures in the manuscript;  
**4. Repositories:** List of repositories and specific scripts used to create all analysis, figures and tables present in the manuscript.
