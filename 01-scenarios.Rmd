# Scenarios

We developed ten scenarios defined as the area used for the calculation of the caribou umbrella index: from 5% to 95% of the study area excluding water, in 10% increments.
With landbirds density on water pixels being equal to zero, we excluded these pixels from BCUI assessment.

```{r figuresScenarios, results="asis"}
scenarios <- seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.1)
listFigures <- as.list(paste0("figures/Scenarios/groupsAveraged_", scenarios,"_boxplot.png"))
names(listFigures) <- paste0("scenario", scenarios)

for (index in 1:length(scenarios)) {
  cat("\n") 
  cat(paste0("## Scenario ", scenarios[index]*100, "%\n")) # Create second level headings with the names.
