# Individual Species Results

We used landbird density models based on climate, vegetation, and terrain variables, fitted as boosted regression trees; these were developed using avian point count data from the Boreal Avian Modelling (BAM) project database.
The BAM database is a compilation of point-count data from projects spanning the boreal and hemi-boreal regions of North America [@Cumming:2010; @Barker:2015].
BAM’s human point-count survey data (1993 to 2018) were supplemented with sampling events extracted from autonomous recording units (ARU) deployed in the Northwest Territories and Alberta (2012 to 2018) by both the Canadian Wildlife Service and the University of Alberta Bioacoustic Unit (WildTrax, 2019).
The species for this study were selected based on the availability of survey data and density offsets [@Solymos:2013] to standardize point-count survey estimates.
This resulted in models for 71 landbird species (Table 1).

## Species Information

The following table provides information on species and how these are generally classified:  

```{r speciesAvailable}
spList <- data.frame(read.csv(header = TRUE, "tables/bird_species_oct2021.csv"))
names(spList)[names(spList) == "ï..Order"] <- "Order"
datatable(spList, options = list(scrollX = TRUE, autoWidth = TRUE,
                                 columnDefs = list(list(width = "200px", targets = c(1, 3)))
)) ## TODO: italicize species names (cols 3:5)
```

## Species Results

The following sections present all individual species results:  

1. **Map of selected areas:** Map that represents the high quality areas chosen for caribou and landbird species for 2031 and 15% of total area.
  Other scenarios can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1oFDas7tzCv3pJgXrr-f7a53N7Gb9Can_).

2. **Linear regression results:** To evaluate temporal trends in BCUI for each landbird species, we did linear regressions of BCUI against projected year and scenario, using both climate models and replicates to assess uncertainty.
  Here we show the model output with `BIRD ~ ProportionAreaChosen + Year` and plotted values with fitted linear model through time, for each scenario.
