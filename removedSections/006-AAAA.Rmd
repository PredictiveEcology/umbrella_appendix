# AAAA

A bird named AAAA does bird things (Figure \@ref(fig:AAAA-plot1)).

```{r AAAA-plot1, fig.cap='Here is a nice AAAA figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.alt='Plot with connected points showing that vapor pressure of mercury increases exponentially as temperature increases.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

It does other bird things too (Table \@ref(tab:AAAA-table1)).

```{r AAAA-table1, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

<!-- TODO:
  Tati, my thought was that you can build a template in this file for a bird species,
  then we can programatically copy/paste the file, replacing the bird code in each copy to match 
  the list of bird species in the results.
